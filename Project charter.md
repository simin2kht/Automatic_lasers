# An automated laser for reducing bird visits to the free range area, farms and airports

## Reason for Undertaking the Project
**Background:** Bird visits to free range areas, farms, and airports can pose significant risks to aviation safety, agriculture, and the environment. Conventional methods have limitations in controlling bird presence effectively.

**Project Goal:** To design, develop, and deploy an automated laser system for reducing bird visits to free range areas, farms, and airports.

**Change Introduced by the Project:**
1. Enhanced bird deterrence and safety.
2. Reduced bird-related damage to crops, equipment, and infrastructure.
3. Improved aviation safety by reducing bird strikes.
4. Environmental benefits by minimizing bird intrusions.

## Objectives and Constraints

**SMART Objectives:**
- **Specific:** Develop an automated laser system.
- **Measurable:** Achieve a 90% reduction in bird visits.
- **Achievable:** Within a budget of $500.
- **Relevant:** To the needs of free range areas, farms, and airports.
- **Time-bound:** Complete the project within 15 weeks.

**In-Scope Items:**
- System design, development, and testing.
- Deployment at selected sites.
- Training for end-users.
- Performance monitoring and data analysis.

**Out-of-Scope Items:**
- Ongoing maintenance and support.
- Long-term environmental impact studies.

**Constraints:**
- Budget limitation of $500.
- Ambient light may affect device performance.
- Weather conditions may affect system performance.
